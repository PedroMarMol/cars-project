<h4>Application that allows an user to track a number of vehicles that they own, its name and its price.</h4>

Whenever a new car is added, existing values inside the form are cleared out. You can also delete cars and the total price would update. The list of cars is searchable. It is allowed to add vehicles with identical names, but it is highlighted if a car with that name already exists.

In this project I learnt how to manage multiple slices with Redux Toolkit.
